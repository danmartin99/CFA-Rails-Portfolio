* Configuration
Once the Portfolio files have been downloaded from github, you will need to ensure that you can run portfolio on your local machine by typing "rails s" in a terminal window in the ./portfolio directory.
Next step is from a web browser type in localhost:3000 in the address line to view the web site on the local machine.
If you have a "Heroku" account you can run the Portfolio web site from there.
To do this cd to ./portfilio on you local machine

Type in the following:-
git status (check that the files exist and are ready to push)
git add .
git commit -m "ready to push"
git push heroku master 

This will push the portfolio files to your heroku account (you will be prompted for your heroku username and password if not already logged in)
